Coding test:
	Please build a slideshow in react
		1. You can get a list of images from the https://unsplash.com API (they return images in batches of 10, but the slideshow should be able to paginate through).
		2. You can use React (but please stay away from slideshow/carousel libraries)
		3. There should be some kind of transition between slides (slide, blur, cross-fade, anything of your choosing).
		4.There should be next/previous buttons. And if the user doesn't click next the slideshow should auto-advance after 10 seconds.
	If you've not played with React in a while, https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app is a pretty good place to start.

				bundler (webpack or Browserfy)
					used to take multiple files into a single one [not needed for the test which will be a single file]
				compiler (Babel)

	Write slideshow:
		- get list of images from unsplash (pure javascript) @done(2017-03-18)
			- obviously this is not in React, but look into how React does it @done(2017-03-18)
				React people use:
					Flux:
						basically this is Facebook's implementation of a M(VM)C
							actions = controller between view and API 
							dispatcher = controller between actions and VM
							store: view model that talks to React view
						skip this for now as it is a whole architecture 
						https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html
						https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-to-know-flux-the-react-js-architecture
					Redux:
						http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/UsageWithReact.html
						a simple VM container that is often used with React
						this would only be needed if we need to store state on client side (cache API calls) which the problem spec doesn't require/suggest

		- make react show images @done(2017-03-18)
			the only React piece I need is to call API on componentDidMount()
			https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html#componentdidmount
		- install bootstrap to style @done(2017-03-18)
		- make react have buttons: next/previous @done(2017-03-18)
			since images don't do anything, there is no need to make them components
			- add buttons @done(2017-03-18)
			- make buttons react @done(2017-03-18)
			- style buttons @done(2017-03-18)
			- disable previous button on page zero @done(2017-03-18)
		- make javascript have a delay and auto advance @done(2017-03-18)
			- reset timeout if the user clicks an action @done(2017-03-18)
			- debug timeout issues @done(2017-03-18)
		- find a way to do transitions (sliding) @done(2017-03-18)
			DO NOT USE Bootstrap Carousel as this would be cheating (it has built in timers for javascript, etc.)
			- look for a ReactJS version of ngAnimate @done(2017-03-18)
				https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/animation.html
		- re-enable API code and keep testing @done(2017-03-18)
	
	Other refinements:
		- animation can be refined a bit
			maybe put every thumbnail in a box that restricts size and dimensions
			there is a brief blink before animation kicks in, that could use some work
			the first load probably should have empty space allocated for it
