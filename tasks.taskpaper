Coding test:
	Please build a slideshow in react
		1. You can get a list of images from the https://unsplash.com API (they return images in batches of 10, but the slideshow should be able to paginate through).
		2. You can use React (but please stay away from slideshow/carousel libraries)
		3. There should be some kind of transition between slides (slide, blur, cross-fade, anything of your choosing).
		4.There should be next/previous buttons. And if the user doesn't click next the slideshow should auto-advance after 10 seconds.
	If you've not played with React in a while, https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app is a pretty good place to start.

	Quickstart:
		get quickstart up and running
		- install nodejs (6.10) and npm (3.10)on laptop @done(2017-03-16)
			https://nodejs.org/en/
			(install fails because: npm ERR! Error: No compatible version found: commander@'^2.9.0')
		- start react app @done(2017-03-16)
				https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app
				sudo npm install -g create-react-app
				create-react-app hello-world
				cd hello-world
				npm start
	Learn react:
		- read overview of react @done(2017-03-16)
				https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html
				package manager (yarn or npm)
					- read yarn docs
				bundler (webpack or Browserfy)
					used to take multiple files into a single one [not needed for the test which will be a single file]
				compiler (Babel)
					allows you to write in jsx or es6 and then compile for compatibility
					[looks like this piece is handled by the create-react-app stuff]
				running react in client applications

	Write slideshow:
		- get list of images from unsplash (pure javascript)
		- make react show images
		- make react have buttons: next/previous
		- make javascript have a delay and auto advance
			- reset timeout if the user clicks an action
		- find a way to do transitions (sliding)
